					<h1>My Story</h1>
					<p>PdotO (real name Siphelele Mnyande) was born in Transkei. With his roots buried in the same homeland as that of Nelson Mandela, P always knew he was born to be different. Raised in Gonubie (East London), he was first introduced to Hip-Hop at an impressionable age. The Hip-Hop from the 90’s was P’s staple: a time characterized by inspirational changes in the industry and true evolution.

					When it comes to his music, he is a perfectionist and for him it’s all about delivery.

					“When I make a record and my words haven’t been heard properly then I fail to see the point of making it in the first place.”

					Not being able to simply be satisfied in excelling musically, in 2009 PdotO completed his Diploma in Performance Art at the Tshwane University of Technology (TUT). Studying Performance Art has been beneficial to his music career, allowing him to conceptualise his rhymes like a script and assess his own strengths and weaknesses in order to transform himself into an even more electric performer.

					Nowadays PdotO is fast becoming a household name alongside industry giants. 2016 saw his musical career rocket with over 5 hit singles and features topping local TV and radio music charts. It’s also the yearin which he will released his long-awaited debut album titled, The Devil’z Playground.

					With a stand-out album title which reflects rising above challenges, PdotO hopes not only to conquer Africa with his musical story but also introduce his music to the entire world and become a living legend.

					2017 saw him release heartfelt singles such as Angels (which was voted as the Top 3 Verse of the Month for April on SlikourOnLife); along with the much-anticipated video for his fan favourite single, Soaked in Bleach.

					With his sophomore album, Under The Sun, set to be released July 2nd 2018, PdotO is fast grabbing the attention of listeners across the globe and has been labelled as one of the few Hip-Hop artists who go beyond just entertaining his audience, but rather giving them music that breathes hope to those that need it.</p>
